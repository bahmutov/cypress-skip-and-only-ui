## Install and use

```shell
npm i -D cypress-skip-and-only-ui
```

Import from your `cypress/support/e2e.js`

```js
import 'cypress-skip-and-only-ui/support';
```

Import and register task from `cypress.config.ts` / `cypress.config.js`

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress'
import skipAndOnlyUiTasks from 'cypress-skip-and-only-ui/task';

export default defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      on('task', skipAndOnlyUiTasks)
    }
  }
});
```

Note: if you have other tasks already, just merge the objects before registering

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress'
import skipAndOnlyUiTasks from 'cypress-skip-and-only-ui/task';

const otherTasks = [{ ... }]
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('task', {
    ...otherTasks,
    ...skipAndOnlyUiTasks
  })
}
```
